Version
-------

Sketchfab Plugin v1.0.0 for Blender

#### Note from OSX Blender users
The plugin can have issues to check if it is up-to-date. It's due to openssl using a protocol not alowed anymore on gihtub urls, for security concerns.
One possible fix is to update openssl (or the ssl client your using).
Version check is not mandatory to use the plugin, but you might miss some important updates.

If you are in this case, be sure to check (on a regular basis) if you're using the latest version of the plugin by comparing your version with the one available on https://sketchfab.com/importers/
